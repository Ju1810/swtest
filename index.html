					<h3>Book I</br>THE OLD REPUBLIC: REVAN</h3>
					<p>There's something out there: a juggernaut of evil bearing down to crush the Republic, unless one lone Jedi, shunned and reviled, can stop it.</br></br>A storm is coming, and there is no escape.</br></br>Revan: hero, traitor, conqueror, villain, savior. A Jedi who left Coruscant to defeat Mandalorians - and returned a disciple of the dark side, bent on destroying the Republic. The Jedi Council gave Revan his life back, but the price of redemption was high. His memories have been erased. All that's left are nightmares - and deep, abiding fear.</br></br>What exactly happened beyond the Outer Rim? Revan can't quite remember, yet can't entirely forget. Somehow he stumbled across a terrible secret that threatens the very existence of the Republic. With no idea what it is, or how to stop it, Revan may very well fail, for he's never faced a more powerful and diabolic enemy. But only death can stop him from trying...</p>

					<h3>Book II</br>THE OLD REPUBLIC: DECEIVED</h3>
					<p>Our time has come. For three hundred years we prepared; we grew stronger while you rested in your cradle of power believing your people were safe and protected.</br></br>You were trusted to lead the Republic, but you were deceived, as our powers of the dark side have blinded you….</br>You were deceived and now your Republic shall fall.</br></br>Malgus brought down the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in a brutal assault that shocked the galaxy. But if war crowned him the darkest of the Sith heroes, peace would transform him into something far more heinous—something Malgus would never want to be, but cannot stop, any more than he can stop the rogue Jedi fast approaching.</br></br>Her name is Aryn Leneer—and the lone Knight that Malgus cut down in the fierce battle for the Jedi Temple was her Master. And now she's going to find out what happened to him, even if it means breaking every rule in the book...</p>

					<h3>Book III</br>THE OLD REPUBLIC: FATAL ALLIANCE</h3>
					<p>Tassaa Bareesh, a matriarch in the Hutt crime cartel, is holding an auction that's drawing attention from across the galaxy. Representatives of both the Republic and the Sith Empire are present, along with a Jedi Padawan sent to investigate, a disenfranchised trooper drummed out of the Republic's elite Black Star Squad, and a mysterious Mandalorian with a private agenda. But the Republic's envoy is not what he seems, the Empire's delegate is a ruthless Sith apprentice, the Jedi Padawan is determined to do the right thing, the trooper hopes to redeem her reputation, and the Mandalorian is somehow managing to keep one step ahead of everyone.</br></br>None of these guests have any intention of participating in the auction. Instead they plan to steal the prize, which is locked inside an impregnable vault: two burned chunks of an exploded star cruiser, one of which may hold the key to the wealth of an entire world.</br>But the truth about the treasure is dangerous and deadly. And in the end, Sith and Jedi, Republic and Empire, must join together to stop a powerful threat that could destroy the galaxy...</p>

					<h3>Book IV</br>THE OLD REPUBLIC: ANNIHILATION</h3>
					<p>The Sith Empire is in flux. The Emperor is missing, presumed dead, and an ambitious Sith Lord's attempt to seize the throne has ended fatally. Still, Darth Karrid continues her relentless efforts to achieve total Sith domination of the galaxy.</br></br>But Karrid's ruthless determination is more than matched in the steely resolve of Theron Shan, whose unfinished business with the Empire could change the course of the war for good. Though the son of a Jedi Master, Theron does not wield the Force, but the spirit of rebellion is in his blood. As a top covert agent for the Republic, he struck a crucial blow against the Empire by exposing and destroying a Sith superweapon arsenal.</br></br>Joined by hot-headed smuggler Teff'ith, with whom he has an inexplicable bond, and wise Jedi warrior Gnost-Dural, Darth Karrid's former master, Theron must match wits and weapons with a battle-tested crew of the most cold-blooded dark side disciples. But time is brutally short. And if they don't seize their one chance to succeed, they will surely have countless opportunities to die...

					<h3>Book II</br>DARTH BANE: RULE OF TWO</h3>
					<p>Two there should be; no more, no less. One to embody the power, the other to crave it.</br></br>

					<p>If the dark side's most powerful master can capture the ultimate secret, the Sith will never die and neither will Darth Bane.</br></br>Twenty years have passed since Darth Bane, reigning Dark Lord of the Sith, demolished the ancient order devoted to the dark side and reinvented it as a circle of two: one Master to wield the power and pass on the wisdom, and one apprentice to learn, challenge, and ultimately usurp the Dark Lord in a duel to the death. But Bane's acolyte, Zannah, has yet to prove herself a worthy successor. Determined that the Sith dream of galactic domination will not die with him, Bane vows to learn the secret of a forgotten Dark Lord that will assure the Sith's immortality and his own.</br></br>Zannah knows that her ruthless master has begun to doubt her, and so she prepares for his downfall, plotting at last to wrest from Bane the title of Dark Lord of the Sith.

					<h3>RED HARVEST</h3>
					<p>The era of the Old Republic is a dark and dangerous time, as Jedi Knights valiantly battle the Sith Lords and their ruthless armies. But the Sith have disturbing plans and none more so than the fulfillment of Darth Scabrous's fanatical dream, which is about to become nightmarish reality.</br></br>Unlike those other Jedi sidelined to the Agricultural Corps, Hestizo Trace possesses one extraordinary Force talent: a gift with plants. Suddenly her quiet existence among greenhouse and garden specimens is violently destroyed by the arrival of an emissary from Darth Scabrous. For the rare black orchid that she has nurtured and bonded with is the final ingredient in an ancient Sith formula that promises to grant Darth Scabrous his greatest desire.</br></br>But at the heart of the formula is a never-before-seen virus that's worse than fatal, it doesn't just kill, it transforms. Now the rotting, ravenous dead are rising, driven by a bloodthirsty hunger for all things living—and commanded by a Sith Master with an insatiable lust for power and the ultimate prize: immortality. No matter the cost...</p>
